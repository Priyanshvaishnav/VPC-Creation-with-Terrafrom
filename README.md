VPC Creation with Terraform

Introduction
This project demonstrates how to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool. By defining and provisioning your infrastructure with Terraform, you can ensure consistency and reliability across your cloud environments.


Objectives
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define and manage your VPC infrastructure using Terraform.
Scalability: Showcase the scalability and reproducibility of infrastructure setups.
Best Practices: Follow industry best practices for infrastructure management and version control.


No problem! Here is an updated version of your README file without the CI/CD pipeline section:
